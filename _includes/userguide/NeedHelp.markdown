This e-mail will be seen by all Palmetto and DataScience support team members, and the person who can best handle your request will respond.  The response time can vary from about 15 minutes to more than a day, depending on the problem (and depending on how busy the support team is), and support requests are only received/processed during regular daytime business hours.

Thanks for your patience!

It's very helpful if you can include this information with your message (if appropriate):

E-mail <ithelp@clemson.edu>  with the word  DataScience  in the subject line.

This e-mail will be seen by all Palmetto and DataScience support team members, and the person who can best handle your request will respond.  The response time can vary from about 15 minutes to more than a day, depending on the problem (and depending on how busy the support team is), and support requests are only received/processed during regular daytime business hours.

Thanks for your patience!

It's very helpful if you can include this information with your message (if appropriate):

-  Hadoop job ID number
-  The commands used to submit the job to the Cypress cluster
-  Paste a copy of the error message you see when the problem occurs

Further information about what to do in an emergency can be found in the [Palmetto's User Guide](http://citi.clemson.edu/hadoop/pages/userguide.html#help)

The Cypress worker nodes (dsci[001-040].palmetto.clemson.edu) have the ability to load all the software modules available on Palmetto via **module add** and **module load** just like any Palmetto compute nodes. However, without the support of PBS, the parallel capability of these loaded software packages are fairly limited.

The DSCI worker nodes (dsci[001-16].palmetto.clemson.edu) have the ability to load all the software modules available on Palmetto via **module add** and **module load** just like any Palmetto compute nodes. However, without the support of PBS, the parallel capability of these loaded software packages are fairly limited. More information about these software can be found at the [Palmetto Software Guide](http://citi.clemson.edu/palmetto/pages/software.html).

1. Directory structure 
===========================================================
-+- assets/ -+- css/
 |           +- fonts/
 |           +- js/
 |
 +- _config.yml
 |
 +- _data/
 |
 +- deploy.sh 
 |
 +- files/
 |
 +- images/
 |
 +- _includes/ -+- owners/
 |              +- software/
 |              +- userguide/
 |
 +- index.html
 | 
 +- _layouts/
 |
 +- pages/
 |
 +- README
 |

The generated product is the directory `_site`. All other files are 
templates and raw markdown files with the content.

2. Modifications and building new version
===========================================================

Jekyll requires a modern version of Ruby which is provided with a module

Modify the documentation as you wish and build the new version of the page.
Afther that run the script `build.sh`

$ ./build.sh

Upload the updated version to Clemix 

$ ./deploy.sh 

To modify the content of any existing page look at the content of directories 
_includes/userguide , _inludes/software and _includes/owners. All of these directories 
contain multiple `markdown` files that correspond to each section on the final page. 
Modify the content as you wish using the markdown syntax. 

3. Adding new sections 
===========================================================

If you decide to add new section under "User's Guide", "Software Guide"
or "Owner's Guide" you will have :

a) add a markdown file with the content to appropriate directory
under `_includes` i.e. `_includes/userguide` for new "User's Guide" section,
`_includes/software` for new "Software Guide" section or `_includes/owners`
for new "Owner's Guide" section.

b) add an entry in appropriate file in `_data` directory (either _data/userguide.yml,
_data/software.yml or _data/owners.yml). This entry has to look like this 

- id: storage
  path: owners/PurchaseStorage.markdown
  mainTitle: Purchase of Palmetto Storage
  navTitle: Purchase of storage

Where "id" is a key for ScrollSpy tracker and links, "path" is a relative path
to the new file that you are adding, "mainTitle" is the title of the new section
that appears in the body of the page and "navTitle" is the short title in the 
navigation panel on the left. 

That should be enough. Build and upload.

c) $ jekyll build
d) $ sh deploy.sh
